# ft_containers

***This project re-implements several STL containers in C++, including `vector`, `map` and `stack`.***

## Technical requirements

- The coding language is `C++98`. 
- The namespaces will be `ft` and all containers will be tested using `ft::<container>`.
- You cannot implement more `public functions` than the ones offered in the standard containers. Everything else must be private or protected. Each public function variable must be justified.
- For non-member overloads, the keyword `friend` is allowed. Each use of friend must be justified and will be checked during evaluation.
