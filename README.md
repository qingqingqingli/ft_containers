# ft_containers

***The project re-implement several STL containers in C++, including `list`, `vector`, `map`, `stack` and `queue`.***

## Technical requirements

- The namespaces will be `ft` and all containers will be tested using `ft::<container>`.
- The coding language is C++98.
- The member function `get_allocator` is not expected here, the remaining member functions are. `Non-member overloads` are expected as well.
- You cannot implement more `public functions` than the ones offered in the standard containers. Everything else must be private or protected. Each public function variable must be justified.
- For non-member overloads, the keyword `friend` is allowed. Each use of friend must be justified and will be checked during evaluation.
